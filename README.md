### How to Use

This demo app showcases the versatility and capabilities of the `@txnlab/use-wallet` library. You can experiment by tweaking various aspects of the configuration:

1. **Wallet Providers**: Add or remove wallet providers

2. **Algorand Node Configuration**: This demo app connects to Algorand Mainnet. You can change the node configuration to connect to Testnet or Betanet, using [AlgoNode's public nodes](https://algonode.io/api/#free-as-in--algorand-api-access) or your own. Please note that currently only KMD, MyAlgo, and AlgoSigner support Betanet.

3. **WalletConnect Support**: To integrate the WalletConnect provider, you'll need a unique project ID. Obtain it by:
   - Registering an account at [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
   - Creating a new project within your account. Each app needs its own unique project ID.

Full installation and configuration instructions for `@txnlab/use-wallet` can be found in the official repository: [TxnLab/use-wallet](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet). This will guide you through additional features supported by the library that might not be present in this basic example.
